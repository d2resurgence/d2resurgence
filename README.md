# Resurgence
A mod for Diablo II: Lord of Destruction and Diablo II: Resurrected. This repository hosts the patch files for the latest release.

Visit [the main page](https://d2resurgence.github.io/) for general information on the mod. Our [Discord](https://discord.gg/SrbNuxyTEb) can also be a great source of knowledge. 

## Diablo II: Lord of Destruction
The Legacy version can be installed and played online by using [our launcher](https://github.com/DoctorWoot420/resurgence-launcher). 

## Diablo II: Resurrected
The Resurrected version is currently in Beta and updates are infrequent, but it is playable. Unlike Legacy Resurgence, there is no multiplayer. Visit the [Nexus Mods page](https://www.nexusmods.com/diablo2resurrected/mods/128/) for details and installation information.

Currently just half-assing this by stealing the welcome post stickied on the subreddit. Will update properly later.

IAmTrial (Mir Drualga) the madman who does D2HD + other crazy stuff.
planqi is the best for keeping BH updated.
AlphA for being cool and making things that look cool.

Credits

This patch wouldn't be possible without the vast amount of information available at the Phrozen Keep. Important acknowledgements for: Kingpin, volf, Nefarius, Paul Siramy, Necrolis, Brother Laz, whist, devurandom, dav92. Credits for majority of new art to Ric Faith, fishynsmelly, JBouley, Shadowtalon, cla$$is, Taara, Inertias, Eimernase. Some item art is shamelessly stolen from Path of Exile, Two Worlds, Titan Quest and Grim Dawn (go check out these games!).

Huge thanks to /u/AlvinsH0TJuicebox
 from vastnet for hosting our server from day one. We would've been gone a long time ago without him, great service provider so do check them out if you're in the market :)

Props to all contributors to Resurgence Wiki (player edited).
