Visit [the main page](https://d2resurgence.github.io/) for general information on the mod. Our [Discord](https://discord.gg/SrbNuxyTEb) can also be a great source of knowledge. 

## Diablo II: Lord of Destruction
The Legacy version can be installed and played online by using [our launcher](https://github.com/DoctorWoot420/resurgence-launcher). 

## Diablo II: Resurrected
The Resurrected version is currently in Beta and updates are infrequent, but it is playable. Unlike Legacy Resurgence, there is no multiplayer. Visit the [Nexus Mods page](https://www.nexusmods.com/diablo2resurrected/mods/128/) for details and installation information.
