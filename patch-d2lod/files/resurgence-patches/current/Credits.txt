Currently just half-assing this by stealing the welcome post stickied on the subreddit. Will update properly later.

Credits

This patch wouldn't be possible without the vast amount of information available at the Phrozen Keep. Important acknowledgements for: Kingpin, volf, Nefarius, Paul Siramy, Necrolis, Brother Laz, whist, devurandom, dav92. Credits for majority of new art to Ric Faith, fishynsmelly, JBouley, Shadowtalon, cla$$is, Taara, Inertias, Eimernase. Some item art is shamelessly stolen from Path of Exile, Two Worlds, Titan Quest and Grim Dawn (go check out these games!).

Huge thanks to /u/AlvinsH0TJuicebox
 from vastnet for hosting our server from day one. We would've been gone a long time ago without him, great service provider so do check them out if you're in the market :)

Props to all contributors to Resurgence Wiki (player edited).
